# Overview

Mezon Webhooks is a powerful feature that allows you to automatically send messages to channels and users through HTTP POST requests. With webhooks, you can integrate external systems and automate notification workflows in Mezon.

## Types of Webhooks

Mezon provides two main types of webhooks:

### Channel Webhook
Channel Webhook allows you to send messages directly to a specific channel in a clan. Messages are sent from a customizable bot user with a name and avatar, making it easy to identify the source of notifications.

**When to use:**
- System notifications for the entire clan or team
- CI/CD pipeline integrations
- Logging and monitoring alerts
- Automation workflows

### Clan Webhook
Clan Webhook allows you to send Direct Messages (DM) directly to individual users in your clan. Messages are sent based on the username or user ID specified in the URL.

**When to use:**
- Personal notifications for individual users
- Private alerts and notifications
- Personal updates and reminders
- One-to-one communication from external systems

## How It Works

1. **Create Webhook**: Set up a webhook integration in channel or clan settings
2. **Get URL**: Copy the webhook URL with its security token
3. **Send Request**: Make an HTTP POST request with JSON payload to the webhook URL
4. **Receive Message**: Message appears in the channel or user's inbox

## Get Started

To start using webhooks:

1. View detailed guides for [Channel Webhook](./channel-webhook) or [Clan Webhook](./clan-webhook)
2. Create a webhook in the Mezon application
3. Use the provided code examples to send messages from your system

:::tip Security Note
Always keep your webhook token secure and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised or exposed.
