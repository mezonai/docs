### How to Join a Clan

You can discover new Clans in two ways:

1. Through the **Discover** button ![join-and-explore-clans-001](./images/join-and-explore-clans-001.png) within the app or directly via the [**Clans Website**](https://mezon.ai/clans/), where you can explore the most active communities on Mezon.
2. Via an **invite link** shared by friends, teammates, or admins.

Simply click **“Join”** to officially become part of that community.
