# Category Order
Category Order allows you to customize the sequence of channel groups in your Clan, helping prioritize important content and keeping the chat space organized and easy to follow.

**Instructions:**

1. In the left menu, select **Category Order**.

<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }}  src={categoryOrder001} alt="Category Order 001" />

2. Drag and drop the categories to arrange them in your preferred order.

<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }}  src={categoryOrder002} alt="Category Order 002" />

3. Click **Save Changes** to apply the new order.

:::warning note
Category order is **personalized for each member**. This means that even if you are the Clan owner, your arrangement will **not affect how other members organize their categories**.
