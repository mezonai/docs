# Audit log

This is where important administrative activities of the Clan are recorded. As the Clan grows and there is more than one Admin, the **Audit Log** allows you to track and review the history of Clan activities in case of incidents or when information needs to be verified.

The Audit Log offers multiple filters to help you quickly find the information you need:

* **By Time** – Filter entries based on a specific date or time range.
* **By User** – Track actions performed by a particular member.
* **By Action** – Search by specific types of activities, such as message edits, deletions, or role changes.
