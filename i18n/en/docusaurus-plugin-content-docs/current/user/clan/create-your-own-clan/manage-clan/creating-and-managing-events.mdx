# Creating & Managing Events
Events are the heartbeat of a community — from team meetings and workshops to social gatherings. On Mezon, you can easily create and manage all these activities in just a few steps.

### **Types of Events:**

When creating an Event, you can choose the format that fits your needs:

1. **Clan Event – Community-wide Event**
   * For large-scale activities open to the entire Clan.
   * Hosted directly in a **Voice Channel**, utilizing all voice, video, screen share, and chat features.
2. **Channel Event – Event within a Channel**
   * Ideal for small groups or specialized topics.
   * Each channel can host its own event, keeping discussions or group activities organized without cluttering the general space.
3. **Private Event – Private, Barrier-free Meeting**
   * Create an online meeting room accessible to anyone — even users without a Mezon account.
   * No login required; participants join directly via the link.
   * Completely free, with no time limits.
   * Full features: voice, video, chat, screen sharing.

**Private Events** can replace Google Meet, Zoom, or Teams in many situations — faster and more flexible.
