# Clan Category

As your Clan grows, the number of channels can increase quickly, making it difficult to keep track. Categories help group related channels, keeping everything organized and easier to navigate for all

### **How to Create a Category:**
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PC" label="PC">
1. Click your **Clan name**, then select **Create Category**. Make sure **Show Empty Category** is enabled.

4. You can move channels between Categories by **dragging and dropping** them into the desired position.

You can also **customize notifications** for a Category, similar to customizing notifications for the Clan or individual channels.

Categories reduce information clutter, save time searching for content, and ensure everyone can easily find the topics they care about. With Categories, the workspace and community on Mezon remain **clear, organized, and easy to manage**, whether your organization has dozens or hundreds of channels.
