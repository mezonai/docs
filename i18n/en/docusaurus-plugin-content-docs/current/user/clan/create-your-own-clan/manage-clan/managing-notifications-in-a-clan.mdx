# Managing Notifications in a Clan
When you first join, the flood of notifications can feel overwhelming. Don’t worry — you can easily adjust them to suit your needs.

### **How to Manage Clan Notifications:**

1. Right-click on the **Clan icon**.
2. Select **Notification Settings**.
3. Choose your preferred option:
   * **All** → Receive all messages.
   * **Only @mention** → Only receive notifications when someone mentions you.
   * **Nothing** → Turn off notifications completely.
   * **Use category default** → Follow the default notification settings of the channel group.
4. Alternatively, use **Mute Channel** to temporarily pause notifications for **15 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours**, or until you turn them back on.

:::warning Note
If you’re in multiple Clans, set most to **Only @mention**. This way, you won’t miss important updates, yet avoid constant “ding” notifications all day.

* ![managing-notifications-in-a-clan-005](./images/managing-notifications-in-a-clan-005.png)**Red Dot next to the Mezon Logo:** You have new notifications.
* ![managing-notifications-in-a-clan-006](./images/managing-notifications-in-a-clan-006.png)**Number next to the Mezon Logo:** Someone mentioned you — the number indicates how many mentions you’ve received.
