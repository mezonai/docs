# Channels

### **How to Create a Channel**

* Click the **“+”** icon in the category where you want to create a channel.
*   There are **3 types of channels**, each serving a different purpose:

<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }} src={channelsImage001} alt="Channels 001" />

    * [**Text Channel**](./channels/text-channel) – The main communication space of the Clan. You can send text messages, images, videos, and store important information.
    * [**Voice Channel**](./channels/voice-channel) – For voice chatting, screen sharing, or video calls. All free, with no limits on time or resolution!
    * [**Live Channel**](./channels/stream-channel) – Where the Clan owner can host broadcasts, talk shows, or regular podcasts.

> When creating a channel, you can enable **Private Mode** so only selected members can see it.

:::warning Note
Each Clan can have a maximum of **500 channels** at the same time.

* Create and configure a **Webhook** for the channel.
* Refer to [**Developer Doc**](/developer/mezon-sdk) for more details on Mezon Webhooks & SDK.

### **Quick Menu**

<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }} src={channelsImage007} alt="Channels 007" />

* **Add Quick Messages** - Save frequently used phrases so you don’t have to type them repeatedly.
  * Example: Instead of typing “Could anyone send me a coffee?” every day, you can save it as a quick message and just type **/givemecoffee** to send it.
* **Add Quick Menu** – Create commands to interact with bots quickly. After creating a quick menu, right-click a message to select and request the bot to perform the corresponding action. See [**Developer Docs**](/developer/mezon-sdk) for setup instructions.

:::warning Note
Quick Menu is available **only in Text Channels**.
:::

### **Delete Channel**

* If a channel is no longer in use or you want to stop it, you can permanently delete it.
