# Canvas
Instead of mixing important documents within the chat, Mezon provides Canvas - a visual note and sharing board directly within the channel.

### **How to Use:**
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PC" label="PC">
<Steps>
<Step title="Open Mezon and select the **Text Channel** or **Thread** where you want to collaborate."></Step>
<Step title="Click the **paper icon** in the chat toolbar.">
<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }}  src={canvas001} alt="Canvas 001" />
</Step>
<Step title="Select **Create** to start a new note.">
<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }}  src={canvas002} alt="Canvas 002" />
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the **title** and **content** you want to share with the group."></Step>
</Steps>

With **Canvas**, all members can update notes in **real-time**. All data is stored centrally, preventing it from being “lost” in the conversation. This helps the team save time searching and quickly access important information.

1. Open Mezon and select the Text Channel or Thread you want to work in.
2. Tap **Canvas** in the menu.

<div align="left"><img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={canvasMobile001} alt="canvas-mobile-001" /></div>
