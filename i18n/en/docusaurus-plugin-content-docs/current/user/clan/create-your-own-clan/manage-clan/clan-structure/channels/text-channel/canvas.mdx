# Canvas
Instead of mixing important documents within the chat, Mezon provides Canvas - a visual note and sharing board directly within the channel.

### **How to Use:**
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PC" label="PC">
1. Open Mezon and select the **Text Channel** or **Thread** where you want to collaborate.
2. Click the **paper icon** ![canvas-001](./images/canvas-001.png) in the chat toolbar.
3. Select **Create** to start a new note.

<Image style={{ margin: '1rem 2rem' }}  src={canvas002} alt="Canvas 002" />

4. Enter the **title** and **content** you want to share with the group.

With **Canvas**, all members can update notes in **real-time**. All data is stored centrally, preventing it from being “lost” in the conversation. This helps the team save time searching and quickly access important information.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
1. Open Mezon and select the Text Channel or Thread you want to work in.
2. Tap **Canvas** in the menu.

<div align="left"><img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={canvasMobile001} alt="canvas-mobile-001" /></div>

3. Here, you can create a new Canvas and view the list of existing boards.
