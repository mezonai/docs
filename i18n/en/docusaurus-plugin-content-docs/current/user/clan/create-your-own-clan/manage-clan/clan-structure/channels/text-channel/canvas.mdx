# Canvas
Instead of mixing important documents within the chat, Mezon provides Canvas - a visual note and sharing board directly within the channel.

### **How to Use:**

1. Open Mezon and select the **Text Channel** or **Thread** where you want to collaborate.
2. Click the **paper icon** ![canvas-001](./images/canvas-001.png) in the chat toolbar.
3. Select **Create** to start a new note.

4. Enter the **title** and **content** you want to share with the group.

With **Canvas**, all members can update notes in **real-time**. All data is stored centrally, preventing it from being “lost” in the conversation. This helps the team save time searching and quickly access important information.
