# Clan Folder
When you join multiple Clans, the left-hand list can become long and hard to manage. Clan Folder helps you group related Clans together, keeping your interface tidy and easy to navigate.

### **Creating a Folder:**

1. On the main Mezon interface, select the Clan you want to put into a folder.
