# What is a Bot?
Mezon Bots – Smart Assistants at Your Fingertips

Bots on Mezon aren’t just automation tools — they’re an **open platform** where you can create, customize, and connect anything with just a few clicks.\
From managing your Clan, integrating external apps, to building **AI Agents using LLMs** — everything can be done directly within Mezon.

With Bots, you can:

* Automate repetitive tasks and save time.
* Connect and control external applications.
* Manage your Clan as efficiently as a real organization.
* Build games, AI assistants, or any tool you can imagine.

If you have an idea, **a Bot can make it real.**\
Detailed guides on creating and integrating Bots are available in [**Mezon Developer Docs**,](/developer/mezon-sdk/integration-bot-sdk) and you can explore community-built Bots on [**Mezon Discover**](https://top.mezon.ai/).

### Practical Use Cases of Mezon Bots

**1. Clan Management & Coordination Support**

Bots can help you monitor, control, and interact with Clan members automatically.\
A prime example is **KOMU Bot**, used internally at Mezon to manage over 350 remote employees.

**KOMU Bot can:**

* Track online status and remind members who don’t respond.

* Automatically create meeting rooms with the command `*meeting now`.

![what-is-a-bot-002](./images/what-is-a-bot-002.png)

* Record daily check-ins and check-outs.

**2. Workflow Automation**

**KOMU Bot** also automates many daily operations, such as:

* Sending birthday greetings to employees.

* Reminding cleaning duties or periodic reports.

![what-is-a-bot-005](./images/what-is-a-bot-005.png)

* Even powering on office computers remotely with the command `*wol`.

All of this happens **right inside Mezon** — no extra apps or complex interfaces needed.

**3. Integration with External Software**

Mezon Bots can connect with enterprise systems and apps like **Trello, Jira, CRM**, or any platform with an open API.

This allows you to:

* Create tasks, update progress, or view reports directly in Mezon.
* Automatically sync data between Mezon and other platforms.
* Avoid constantly switching between multiple tools.

***

**4. Game Bots – Fun Inside Mezon**

Bots aren’t just for work — they can bring entertainment and community engagement.

For example, **Ainz Bot** is an RPG-style mini-game where players can:

* Hunt, collect, and train virtual creatures.
* Challenge others to level up and earn rare items.
* Build leaderboards and player Clans.

**5. Smart Virtual Assistants – AI Agents on Mezon**

Thanks to integration with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, Mezon Bots can become true AI Agents that work for you in the digital environment.

**Example 1: Email Management Bot**\
With access to your email and Mezon account, this Bot can:

* Summarize new emails every morning.
* Report and display key messages inside Mezon.
* Let you reply directly in Mezon — the Bot sends the actual email for you.

![what-is-a-bot-008](./images/what-is-a-bot-008.png)

**Example 2: Chat Monitoring & Summary Bot**\
Using the **Shadow** feature, Bots can be granted permission to read specific chat channels.\
They can then:

* Automatically summarize key discussions.
* Send daily or mention-based summaries.
* Keep you updated without reading every single line.
