# Safety Guidelines for Bots/Apps
Information security is a top priority at Mezon. Always follow these guidelines below

### Use Trusted Sources Only

Add Bots/Apps from [**top.mezon.ai** ](https://top.mezon.ai/)or other sources that are verified and highly rated by the Mezon community. Avoid unclear or unverified sources.

### Check Permissions Carefully

Before granting access, read and understand the permissions the Bot/App requests. **Never grant Administrator permissions unless absolutely necessary.**

### Limit Access Rights

Only provide the minimum permissions required for the Bot/App to function. This helps protect your Clan’s data and ensures overall security.
